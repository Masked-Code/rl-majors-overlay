                "scorebox-dark": "#"
            }
        }**Note** if this is not the last team in the file there needs to be a comma after the curly brace. Also applies to above teams

To edit the team configs to add or remove teams simply paste the template into the overlay\src\teamconfig.json file

From there just change the top "template" to the team name and fill in the rest of the fields as they are named

The file in panel\src\ will automatically update the next time the overlay is launched
